<h5>Andrew Tate Quotes about Masculinity</h5>

<div class="col2">
<p> “I do know how to administer CPR. However, I will not administer CPR unless you’re a hot female… If you’re some fat dude and you just had a heart attack and I don’t really know you, you’re gonna die… No, not even if you’re a friend…
    If you’re my friend, you just can’t be a p*ssy. ‘Well, I had a heart attack’, get the f*ck up. F*cks wrong with you. Go hospital later. Have a drink, cigarette, cup of coffee, back in the game. F*cking having heart attacks near me, you little p*ssy.”
    </p>

    <p> “You know exactly what to expect from an enemy. An enemy is going to attack you and you know how to deal with that. A friend, on the other hand, can betray you. Betrayal is much worse than an attack from an enemy for two reasons.
        One, it catches you by surprise… And the second thing is, your friend knows you well enough to know your weaknesses and knows exactly how to strike.”
        </p>

        <p> "If you’re a man who doesn’t view life as war, you’re going to lose. Society’s expectations of men is much higher than the societal expectations of females.”
            “The hallmark of a real man is controlling himself, controlling his emotions, and acting appropriately regardless of how he feels.”
            </p>

            <p> “Men who live without self control are the kind of men who cry when their girlfriend cheats on them, ‘cus she certainly does, because she doesn’t respect a little cry baby, and she’s only with you because she’s ugly as f*ck and she has to settle for a little soy boy p*ssy like you.”
                 </p>

                 <p> “If you could choose to build yourself from the ground up… Like from a video game, just tick characteristic boxes and build yourself, nobody would choose to be a liberal soy boy. Nobody would choose to be a small weak guy who has to cry when he gets upset.”</p>
